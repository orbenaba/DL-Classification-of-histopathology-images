# DL-Classification-of-histopathology-images
Early, fast and accurate diagnosis of diseases can often
save lives. Diagnosis of diseases from tissue samples is
done manually by pathologists. Usually, This process
takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money.
Therefore, there is a need for an accurate and automated
systems that can assist pathologists and help them decide
quickly what type of tissue sample is in front of them.
Those systems can give to the pathologists second
opinion in critical cases and help them to save lives.
In this project, a deep-learning based transfer learning
approach has been proposed to classify histopathology
images automatically.
